# Reward Campaign Vault System

A decentralized reward distribution system built on Ethereum that allows creators to set up token-based reward campaigns with secure, automated distribution mechanisms.

## Overview

The Reward Campaign Vault System consists of two main contracts that work together to provide a secure and efficient way to manage token-based reward campaigns:

- **Factory Contract**: Deploys and manages individual campaign vaults using minimal proxy clones for gas efficiency
- **Vault Contract**: Handles individual campaign funding, storage, and reward distribution

## Key Features

### üè≠ Factory Contract
- **Campaign Creation**: Deploy new reward campaigns as gas-efficient minimal proxy clones
- **Token Allowlist**: Maintain a whitelist of approved ERC20 tokens for campaigns
- **Fee Management**: Configurable fee system with designated fee wallet
- **Distributor Management**: Centralized reward distributor authorization
- **Upgrade Mechanism**: Update vault implementation for new campaigns without affecting existing ones

### üè¶ Vault Contract
- **Secure Funding**: Campaign creators fund their vaults with approved ERC20 tokens
- **Automated Fee Deduction**: Fees are automatically deducted during funding
- **Batch Reward Distribution**: Distribute rewards to multiple recipients in a single transaction
- **Campaign Finalization**: One-time reward distribution with permanent campaign closure
- **Token Recovery**: Rescue mechanism for accidentally sent tokens

## Architecture

```
Factory Contract
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Creates minimal proxy clones of Vault implementation
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Manages token allowlist and fee configuration
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Authorizes reward distributors
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Tracks all deployed campaigns

Vault Contract (Proxy)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Initialized by Factory with campaign-specific parameters
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Funded by campaign creator with approved tokens
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Distributes rewards via authorized distributor
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Finalizes campaign after distribution
```

## Workflow

1. **Campaign Creation**: User calls `createCampaign()` on Factory
2. **Vault Deployment**: Factory deploys a minimal proxy clone of Vault
3. **Campaign Funding**: Creator funds the vault with approved ERC20 tokens
4. **Fee Processing**: Factory fee is automatically deducted and sent to fee wallet
5. **Reward Distribution**: Authorized distributor distributes rewards to recipients
6. **Campaign Finalization**: Vault is permanently finalized after distribution

## Security Features

- **Access Control**: Only authorized distributors can distribute rewards
- **One-Time Distribution**: Campaigns can only be finalized once
- **Token Allowlist**: Only pre-approved tokens can be used for campaigns
- **Initialization Protection**: Vaults cannot be re-initialized after deployment
- **Safe Token Transfers**: Uses OpenZeppelin's SafeERC20 for secure token operations

## Gas Optimization

- **Minimal Proxy Pattern**: Reduces deployment costs by ~90% compared to full contract deployment
- **Batch Operations**: Distribute rewards to multiple recipients in single transaction
- **Efficient Storage**: Optimized state variable packing and access patterns

## Foundry Development Environment

This project uses **Foundry**, a blazing fast, portable and modular toolkit for Ethereum application development written in Rust.

Foundry consists of:
-   **Forge**: Ethereum testing framework (like Truffle, Hardhat and DappTools)
-   **Cast**: Swiss army knife for interacting with EVM smart contracts, sending transactions and getting chain data
-   **Anvil**: Local Ethereum node, akin to Ganache, Hardhat Network
-   **Chisel**: Fast, utilitarian, and verbose solidity REPL

## Contract Addresses

After deployment, update this section with the deployed contract addresses:

```
Factory: 0x...
Vault Implementation: 0x...
```

## Usage Examples

### Creating a Campaign

```solidity
// 1. Deploy or get Factory contract instance
IFactory factory = IFactory(FACTORY_ADDRESS);

// 2. Create a new campaign
address vaultAddress = factory.createCampaign();
```

### Funding a Campaign

```solidity
// 1. Get vault instance
IVault vault = IVault(vaultAddress);

// 2. Approve tokens for transfer
IERC20(tokenAddress).approve(vaultAddress, fundingAmount);

// 3. Fund the vault (fees are automatically deducted)
vault.fund(tokenAddress, fundingAmount);
```

### Distributing Rewards

```solidity
// 1. Prepare reward array
IVault.Reward[] memory rewards = new IVault.Reward[](2);
rewards[0] = IVault.Reward(recipient1, amount1);
rewards[1] = IVault.Reward(recipient2, amount2);

// 2. Distribute rewards (only authorized distributor)
vault.distributeRewards(rewards);
```

## Usage

### Build

```shell
$ forge build
```

### Test

```shell
$ forge test
```

### Format

```shell
$ forge fmt
```

### Gas Snapshots

```shell
$ forge snapshot
```

### Anvil

```shell
$ anvil
```

### Deploy

#### Quick Start with Makefile

This project includes a Makefile for simplified operations. First, create your environment configuration:

```shell
# Create .env template
$ make env-template

# Copy and edit the template
$ cp .env.template .env
# Edit .env with your actual values
```

Then deploy using the Makefile:

```shell
# Deploy to configured network
$ make deploy

# Or deploy to specific networks
$ make deploy-local    # Local Anvil
$ make deploy-testnet  # Testnet
$ make deploy-mainnet  # Mainnet (with safety prompts)
```

#### Manual Deployment

Alternatively, deploy manually with Forge:

```shell
$ forge script script/vault/DeployFactory.s.sol:DeployFactory --rpc-url $RPC_URL --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY --broadcast --verify
```

The deployment addresses will be saved to `deployment-addresses-{NETWORK}.txt`.

#### Available Make Commands

```shell
$ make help  # Show all available commands
```

Common commands:
- `make build` - Build contracts
- `make test` - Run tests
- `make deploy` - Deploy to configured network
- `make verify` - Verify contracts on Etherscan
- `make anvil` - Start local development node

### Cast

```shell
$ cast <subcommand>
```

### Help

```shell
$ forge --help
$ anvil --help
$ cast --help
